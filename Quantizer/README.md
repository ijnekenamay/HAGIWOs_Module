# Quantizer

！！ Note ！！

- **This board has never actually been manufactured!** I will get feedback and improve it.
- Unlike the original, the control part and the main board were combined together, so the size is 10hp.
- Kicad's error checking may show unconnected, but you are probably fine.
- See the HAGIWO website for the Arduino code.
- Files for the panel will be created as needed.
